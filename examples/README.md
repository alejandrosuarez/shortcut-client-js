## Usage

You will need to set an environment variable with your API Token. See [../README.md#how-to-get-an-api-token](../README.md#how-to-get-an-api-token) to know how to get an API token.

Then, you can run the file you want with:

```bash
SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN npx ts-node YOUR_FILE
```
